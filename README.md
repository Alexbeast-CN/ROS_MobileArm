# ROS_MobileArm

This is a DriveDream internship project. The robot is a 4-wheel differential driven base with a robotic manipulator. The aim of the project is to:

- Build the mobile manipulator's kinematics and dynamic model.
- Simulate and remote control the robot in Gazebo.
- Let the robot navigate autonomously in a known environment.

## Agenda

**Tim:**
* [x] Create the framework of the repo. 
* [x] Add template files.

**Keyu Ge:**

* [ ] Learn from [champ](https://github.com/chvmp/champ), which is a good example of how a ROS project should be.
* [ ] Create a folder named `kinematics` and do the following tasks (This can hold on):
    * [ ] Build the kinematics model of a 4-wheel differential driven vehicel.

**Yijie Gong:**

* [ ] Study ROS2.
* [ ] Create a folder named `robot_description`  and do the following tasks:
    * [ ] Write/build a 4-wheel_robot_model.urdf (or in .xacro, chose one).
    * [ ] Display the robot in rviz.
