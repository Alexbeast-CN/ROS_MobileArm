# How to learn ROS 

## 1. Official ROS Website:

- [Web | ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/) is just like other wikis, you can find some basic information about ROS.
- [Web | ROS Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/) can help you learn about how to use the core component of ROS. 
- [Web | ROS Answers](https://answers.ros.org/questions/) is just like the ROS version of StackOverflow. You can ask questions and get answers here.

## 2. Lectures:

## 3. Basic Examples:

- [Github | Turtlebot](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot) is a good example for you to learn ROS. It is a simple robot with a 2D laser scanner and differential drive.
- [Github | ar3_core](https://github.com/ongdexter/ar3_core) is a simple robotic arm project that can help you learn how to use ros_contorl and moveit.


## 4. Advanced Robotics:

- [Github | Navigation2](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2) is an advanced navigation stack for ROS2. It implements nearly all the frequent used navigation algorithms.
- [Github | Moveit](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit) is an advanced motion planning framework for robotic arms.
- [Github | Drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake) is a C++ toolbox for model-based design and verification of robotics systems.
